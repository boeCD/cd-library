# JavaScript DOM Event Library

This is a simple JavaScript library that allows you to execute code both **before** and **after** the website's DOM is loaded.

## Features

- **Pre-DOM Execution**: Code can be executed immediately when the script is loaded, even before the DOM is fully ready.
- **Post-DOM Execution**: Code can be executed as soon as the DOM is fully loaded, using the `DOMContentLoaded` event listener.

## Usage

### 1. Include the Script

To use this JavaScript library, include the script in your HTML file as follows:

```html
<script src="path/to/your-library.js"></script>
